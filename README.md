# Product-preview-card-component

The challenge of this project was to build a responsive product preview card component.

# Built with:

    - Semantic HTML5 markup
    - CSS custom properties
    - Flexbox
    - CSS Grid
    - media queries

# What I learned

    - media queries: this was my first project where I used media queries to create a responsive website for mobile phones

    - <picture> element: I learned how to use the <picture> element to provide different images for different screen sizes. Also, I am planning to improve on using responsive images using just the "srcset" attribute for resolution switches and learn more about device pixel ratio (DPR).

    - fonts: I had the chance in this project to learn how to ise Google fonts, by using two different custom fonts: Monsterrat and Fraunces. In the future  I am looking to improve by using @font-face as well in my projects.
